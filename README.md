# Music and the Macrocosmos App

This will eventually turn into an app that will hold Python versions of all the current Tone.js instrument projects (Square Sounds, Conway's Game of Sound, Synth Sandbox, and HexGrid) as well as allow users to create their own instruments with Python.

We'll be using the `pyo` package for audio; documentation here: http://ajaxsoundstudio.com/pyodoc/

Install it from the command line with `pip3 install pyo`

The `pyo-examples` folder in this folder contains working examples with `pyo` from the package's github: https://github.com/belangeo/pyo

In the repo the location is pyo/pyo/examples
